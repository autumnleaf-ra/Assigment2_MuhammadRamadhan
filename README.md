## ReactJS - Country List
My task is task is integrating with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

> **Notes**:
> Your users should be able to:
> - See all countries from the API on the homepage
> - Search for a country using an `input` field
> - Filter countries by region
> - Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
> - Click through to the border countries on the detail page
> - View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
> - See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
> - **Bonus**: Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
